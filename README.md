# pyAssigment3

The third assignment in learning Python. Code is written by Joel and Henry (Team name is pending). We create a python program to run on an ATM machine. 

We write a function that asks a user to input his name, PIN number(we create a variable for 
the PIN to be matched), and the amount to withdraw. The system should be able to check if the amount to withdraw 
is <= to the amount on the account, and then debit the sum for withdraw if the condition is met, then show the balance 
of the remaining amount.
